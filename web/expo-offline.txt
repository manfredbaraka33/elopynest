Developing an Expo Go app offline using USB debugging is a reliable method that's similar to traditional Android development. 
This approach allows your phone to connect directly to your computer's local server, bypassing the need for an internet connection for code transfer.

### Setting Up USB Debugging for Expo Go
1.  **Enable Developer Mode on your Android Phone:**
    * Go to **Settings > About phone**.
    * Tap the **Build number** seven times. A message will appear saying, "You are now a developer!".
2.  **Enable USB Debugging:**
    * Go back to **Settings**, and you'll find a new **Developer options** menu.
    * In the Developer options menu, turn on **USB debugging**.
3.  **Connect your phone to your computer** with a USB cable.
    * When you plug it in, your phone will likely ask, "**Allow USB debugging?**".
    * Select **Always allow from this computer** and tap **OK**. This prevents the prompt from appearing every time you connect.
4.  **Run your Expo app:**
    * Open your project folder in your terminal.
    * Run the command `npx expo start --localhost`.
    * This starts the development server, but instead of using a public URL or a local IP that needs a network connection, it's only accessible on your computer's localhost.
5.  **View on your device:**
    * In the terminal, you'll see a menu with options to run the app. Press the **'a'** key to open the app on your Android device.
    * Expo Go will automatically detect the connection and load the app from your computer's local server via the USB cable.

### How it Works
When you run `npx expo start --localhost`, the Expo development server is configured to be accessed only from the local machine.
 By enabling USB debugging and connecting your phone, you create a direct tunnel.  This allows your phone to access services running on your computer as if they were on the same network. 
This means that all the code updates, console logs, and hot reloading features work seamlessly over the USB cable, making it a robust and dependable method for offline development.
